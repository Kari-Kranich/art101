		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add intex.html files.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I found that working with the file structure wasn't too complicated. I mainly just had difficulties making sure all my css files were working correctly. </p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> These are the index.html file I created and the structure that I made:</p>
		<img src="img/file_structure.png" width=650>
		<img src="img/indexyyy.png" width=650>

</body>
</html>
